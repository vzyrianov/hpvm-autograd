PredTuner Autotuning API
========================

:doc:`pytorch-app` documents a high-level API for autotuning PyTorch Module.

PredTuner also supports predictive tuning of general applications that are not PyTorch Module,
or even empirical tuning of general application that doesn't support predictive models.
These lower-level APIs are documented in :doc:`modeled-app` and :doc:`approx-app` respectively.
